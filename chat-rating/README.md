## Chat rating

Chat rating system is a rapidly evolving hot thing now for a few reasons. When using ChatGPT or other types of language models, we notice a lot of mistakes, bias or other things we think might be better in the response. Now imagine this on a large scale -- being able to rate the chat you’re having with the model and improve the performance on the training level. Why is this so  useful?
It’s so simple -- by having chat annotation system, you’ll assure continuously better responses from the chat and more advanced prompts over time.
