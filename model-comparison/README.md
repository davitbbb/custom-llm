## Model comparison

Suppose you want to receive the best result possible for your queries and want to test a few of the existing models like ChatGPT, Cohere, Bard, etc., and choose the one that fits best for you. Check the code that does this for you in SuperAnnotate's LLM editor.

2. In the form builder, import ``model-comparison-template.json`` template using **Import** button on the top right menu
3. Press **Next**. You will be redirected to the codding area.
4. On the top left side press **Variables** button (next to the **Preview** button)
5. Update ``open_ai_api_key`` and ``cohere_api_key`` values with your **OpenAI** and **Cohere** valid keys respectively
6. Press **Publish** button
7. Generate as many forms as you need
